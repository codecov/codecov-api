We need to override the base Django migrate command to handle the legacy migrations we have in the "legacy_migrations" app.
Those migrations are the source of truth for the initial db state, which is captured in Django migrations 0001 for the
core, codecov_auth and reports apps. Thus we need to fake out the initial migrations for those apps to apply duplicate migration
steps eg. creating the same table twice.  The source of truth for all other state is captured in the standard Django migrations
and can be safely applied after runnin the legacy migrations.
